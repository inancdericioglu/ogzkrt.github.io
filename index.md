After that I got a scholarship from Turkish Ministiry of Education and I've completed MSc. in Cyber Security from University of Southampton in 2019. My dissertation was 'Machine Learning based attack detection on IoT environment'. Since then I been working as Software Developer at Institute of Information and Communications Technologies(Turkey).
